# Notes
## Voter Registration and Verification

## Vote Counting
Two separate systems must be implemented:
- A voter registration and verification system. This will keep track of if a voter has voted yet or not for a given voting session.
- A vote collection system. This will contain only the votes themselves (the id candidate that received the vote and the voting session id).
